The Coke Market in October 2022 
 
The outlook for the world economy continues to deteriorate, but commodity 
prices stabilized and even recovered to a degree this month.  
 
Chinese coke prices have been $390-410/tonne fob this month, broadly similar 
to the levels of the past two months. Indications have been remarkably stable 
in the past few weeks, with no trend either up or down. Domestic coke prices 
increased by ¥90 per tonne this month over September, but due to the strength 
of the US dollar against the yuan, there was no increase in the export price. 
 
Exports of coke from China continue to rise.  In September, Chinese exports 
totaled almost 1.3m tonnes, up from 1.0m tonnes in the previous month and 
the highest monthly total in more than six years. The banning of Russian coke 
from the EU has led to more demand for Chinese coke, and there also appears 
to have been lower availability from Japan this year compared to 2021.  
 
From $425-440/tonne cfr in September, Indian coke prices increased 
marginally to $440-450/tonne this month. Overall, the trend in price remains 
upwards, primarily on the back of rising coking coal prices. In Europe, on the 
other hand, the trend remains negative. There was a reduction of €140-
150/tonne in the foundry coke price, taking it to €710-740/tonne ($703-
733/tonne) delivered this quarter. Blast furnace coke is lower by $20/tonne 
from last month, taking the indication to $400-420/tonne cfr. Stocks are rising 
in Europe due to lower iron and steel production, so there is little demand. 
 
We estimate provisionally that world coke trade was 6.9m tonnes in the 
third quarter, down from 7.4m tonnes in the previous quarter.  This level 
would still be above the quarterly average for the past two years. Coke trade 
was higher last quarter in Asia and Brazil but lower in Europe. As indicated 
previously, China’s share of world coke trade was higher in the third quarter: 
we estimate that it was 46%, up from 25% in the first quarter and 34% in the 
second quarter.  
 
Coking coal prices continued their upward momentum from last month, 
exceeding $290/tonne fob in the last few weeks.  From a range of $260-
275/tonne fob last month, in October the range has been $275-295/tonne fob. 
Third-quarter metallurgical coal trade was lower in Europe and Brazil but 
higher in the Asian markets. In China, imports increased sharply to 19m 
tonnes, 40% up on the previous quarter.

COKE MARKET REPORT 
— October 2022 — We estimate that world iron output will total 1.30bn tonnes in 2022, which 
would be 2% lower than last year.  In each of the years 2016 to 2021 there 
was an increase in world iron output, so this year would be first in six years to 
see a decline. Growth has primarily been centred in China, India and some 
other developing Asia economies. Undertakings by many countries to “net 
zero carbon emissions” by 2050 has not led to any noticeable shift away from 
steelmaking based on the coke-fueled blast furnace, therefore. Average 
growth in the ten years up to 2022 was almost 2% per year. 
 
After declining steeply from May to July, world iron output has since seen a 
minor recovery, reaching 1.30bn tonnes last month on an annualized and 
seasonally adjusted basis. This represented a 3% rise from August. In Europe 
and North America, however, the trend remains quite negative. 
 
Europe 
 
In a potentially important ruling, the European Commission has declared 
that the use of German government funds for the “de-carbonization” of 
steelmaking at Salzgitter is compatible with EU law.  A total of €1bn of 
investment from the federal and Lower Saxony state governments will be put 
towards the introduction of so-called “SALCOS”, standing for Salzgitter Low 
CO2 Steelmaking. Together with €0.7bn from Salzgitter, this will enable the 
first stage to be completed by 2025, consisting of two direct-reduction iron 
(DRI) plants and three electric-arc furnaces. This will incrementally lead to 
the phase-out of coke-based steelmaking. Salzgitter has two coke batteries, 
with a 1.5m tpy capacity. ThyssenKrupp also recently announced a €2bn 
investment in a 2.5m tpy DRI plant, which would run on either “green” 
hydrogen or more probably natural gas. It is due to be completed by 2026. 
 
Due to shortages in Europe, the closure of the last metallurgical coal mine in 
Czech Republic has been postponed. Originally due to close before the end of 
this year, the CSM mine of OKD will now operate until the end of 2023 at 
least, probably longer. It produced 2.0m tonnes of coking coal last year. This 
year’s planned production is 1.3m tonnes. 
 German steel 
industry invests in 
DRI capacity, 
ultimately leading to 
lower coke 
production and 
demand. Fall in world iron 
output likely this 
year, following six 
years of increases.

— October 2022 — Europe (cont’d) 
 
An explosion at a coal-grinding station temporarily disrupted production at 
JSW’s Przyjazn plant in Poland last month, but operations have now returned 
to normal with minimal loss of production. The grinding plant should be 
rebuilt by April next year. The rebuild of battery #4 at Przyjazn began last 
year and is continuing. It is due to be completed in 2024, when battery #2 will 
close permanently. So Przyjazn’s capacity will remain at around 2.7m tpy. 
Earlier this year, ownership of the small Bytom coke plant in Poland changed 
as well as the management. As a result, there has been some increase in 
production. Its capacity has been around 0.2m tpy, producing several grades 
of coke for the open market. 
 
Asia  
 
ThyssenKrupp Uhde is to build and supply a coke battery for Nippon Coke & 
Engineering (NCE) at Kitakyushu, Japan. The top-charged, low-emission 
battery will replace existing battery #2A, originally built in 1980. Currently, 
it is scheduled to start producing in August 2024. The three remaining 
batteries at Kitakyushu are also to be rebuilt or repaired, but there is no 
schedule for this yet. The 2.0m tpy capacity at NCE produces for the merchant 
market, both domestic and export. 
 
Indian coke producers are claiming that the government’s cancellation of 
5% duty on coke imports back in May is leading to lower prices in the 
domestic market.  At the same time, the duty on imported coking coal of 2.5% 
was also cancelled, something which would benefit the coke producers. From 
0.6m tonnes in the first quarter, Indian coke imports have increased to 0.7m 
tonnes in the second quarter and an estimated 0.8m tonnes in the third quarter. 
Merchant coke capacity in India is estimated to be around 6m tpy, but actual 
production would be 60-70% of this. 
 
Americas 
 
Port data show that Colombian coke exports were 0.90m tonnes in the third 
quarter, a decline of 8% from the previous quarter. The total for the first nine 
months of 2022 was 3.1m tonnes, an increase of 7% from the same period of 
last year, however. Milpa remains the largest single supplier from Colombia, 
its exports totaling almost 0.5m tonnes so far this year. It was followed by 
Trafigura, Excomin, Carbomax de Colombia and Carbones Andinos. 
 
Other markets 
 
Coke production in Turkey is likely to be around 4.7m tonnes in 2022, 
which would be 1-2% up from 2021.  Turkey’s production has increased 
marginally on average over the last ten years. At Isdemir, coke battery #3 
restarted this year following its rebuild by the Chinese company, ACRE. 
Several other coke projects over the past decade have sustained Turkish coke 
production at the current level.
